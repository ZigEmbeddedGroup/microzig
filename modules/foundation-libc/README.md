# Foundation libc

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup/foundation-libc/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ZigEmbeddedGroup/foundation-libc/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A C standard library that only implements a subset of functions that can be safely used without an operating system.
This is called a [freestanding environment](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/freestanding).

This libc is primarily meant to be used with microcontrollers, hobbyist operating systems and so on.

## Support

The first goal is to reach full C11 *freestanding* support.

- No support for locales
- No allocator (ship your own!)
- No support for functions that require an operating system of sorts in the background.
- No support for `wchar_t` and `wchar.h` as it isn't portable between compilers.
- Multi-byte character strings are implemented as UTF-8.

## Customization

Foundation libc doesn't really support much customization/configuration except for the hard required options.

There is [`foundation/libc.h`](include/foundation/libc.h) which documents the behaviour of all required configurations.

Right now, the following configurations exist:

- `foundation_libc_panic_handler`, which allows users to catch detectable undefined behaviour.

You can also configure the libc by chosing the build mode:

- `Debug`: Implements additional safety checks and adds breakpoints in panics.
- `ReleaseSafe`: Keeps the safety checks, but removes breakpoints.
- `ReleaseSmall`: Still keeps a certain amount of safety, but drops long internal strings to reduce code and ram size.
- `ReleaseFast`: Gotta go fast. Drops all safety and assumes all code behaves well.

There are also certain "usage" configurations that can be chosen to affect behaviour when *using* the headers. Those are implemented as C macros/defines:

- `FOUNDATION_LIBC_ASSERT` is a global macro that defines how `assert()` should behave:
  - `FOUNDATION_LIBC_ASSERT_DEFAULT=0`: Behaves like a regular assert that can print file name, assertion message and line.
  - `FOUNDATION_LIBC_ASSERT_NOFILE=1`: Drops the filename from the assertion to reduce code size.
  - `FOUNDATION_LIBC_ASSERT_NOMSG=2`: Additionally drops the assertion message from the assertion to reduce code size.
  - `FOUNDATION_LIBC_ASSERT_EXPECTED=3`: Replaces `assert(‚Ä¶)` with a construct that tells the compiler the assertion is always met. Makes code very fast. Assertions aren't checked.

## Development

Zig Version: 0.11

Run
```sh-session
user@microzig ~/foundation-libc $ zig build
user@microzig ~/foundation-libc $ 
```

to compile the libc and generate a lib file in `zig-out/lib` as well as the headers in `zig-out/include`.

## Contribution

Start by grabbing a header marked with ‚è≥ or üõ† and implement the functions from that header. See if others already have a PR open for those functions so you don't do work twice!

Leverage functions from Zig `std` if possible as they are already well tested and should work.

Which functions belong into which header can be figured out by taking a look at the *C11 Standard Draft* document or the *IBM libc functions* list. [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c) usually has the better docs though, so best check out both.

### Style Guides

- The header files are ment to be as minimal as possible
  - Do not use comments documenting the functions, they are well documented everywhere else.
  - Only insert empty lines between functions if necessarity for clarity
  - Keep function names sorted alphabetically
- Try not to use macros at all
- Use `clang-format` with the provided style file.
