## Supported chips

| Chip     | Targets                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ESP32-C3 | `esp32_c3`, `esp32_c3_direct_boot`, `esp32_c3_flashless`    |
| ESP32-C6 | `esp32_c6`, `esp32_c6_direct_boot`, `esp32_c6_flashless`    |

The esp32c6 port covers the chip bring up (clocks, cache, watchdogs, interrupt controller), gpio,
the system timer and the usb serial/jtag logger. `hal.i2c`, `hal.spi`, `hal.ledc`, `hal.rtos` and
`hal.radio` have not been ported to it yet and still speak to esp32c3 registers, so they only
compile when their chip supports them.

## Chip specific code

Most of the hal is shared. Where a peripheral differs between chips, the module either switches on
`compatibility.chip` inline (`cache.zig`, `rom.zig`) or forwards to a per chip implementation:

- `hal/clocks.zig` -> `hal/clocks/<chip>.zig`
- `hal/system.zig` -> `hal/system/<chip>.zig`
- `hal/gpio.zig` -> `hal/gpio/<chip>.zig`
- `cpus/esp_riscv.zig` -> `cpus/esp_riscv/<chip>.zig`, selected through the `cpu-config` module

The main differences between the two chips:

- The esp32c6 gates every peripheral from its own PCR configuration register instead of the two
  PERIP_CLK_ENx bitmasks of the esp32c3.
- Its pll is fixed at 480 MHz and the cpu frequency comes from a divider, and its apb clock stays
  at 40 MHz instead of following the cpu.
- The interrupt matrix (INTERRUPT_CORE0) and the cpu interrupt controller (INTPRI) are two
  separate peripherals.
- Its rtc watchdogs live in the low power domain (LP_WDT).
- It has 31 pads instead of 22, the usb serial/jtag pins are GPIO12 and GPIO13 instead of GPIO18
  and GPIO19, and every drive strength maps straight onto its register value.
- Instruction and data share one address space, both for flash (IROM and DROM at 0x42000000) and
  for sram (IRAM and DRAM at 0x40800000), which is why `ld/esp32_c6/image_boot_sections.ld` places
  the rodata first and walks a single region instead of offsetting the two views against each
  other with dummy sections.

## Local changes to the vendored SVDs

`src/chips/ESP32-C6.svd` is the esp-pacs base SVD with one fix: `DMA.OUT_CONF0_CH%s` (dim 2 at
offset 0x190) got a `<dimIndex>1,2</dimIndex>`. Without it the array is numbered from zero and
collides with the explicit `OUT_CONF0_CH0` at offset 0xD0.
