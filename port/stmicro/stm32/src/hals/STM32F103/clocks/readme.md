# Compile-Time Clock Configuration

This is a **test** of a precise clock configuration method, using data collected directly from CubeMX.

The goal is to enable any clock configuration with useful error messages for incorrect setups, similar to how CubeMX operates. Currently, only compile-time configurations are supported, but runtime configuration support is planned.

At the moment, only the STM32F102/3/4xx series is being ported to microzig. However, most mainstream STM32 family chips have some level of configuration available. You can check the support status at: [ClockHelper-zig](https://github.com/RecursiveError/ClockHelper-zig).

# Bugs and Feature Requests
These files were generated automatically. Configuration errors or incomplete functionalities may exist. If you make manual modifications, consider opening an issue in the project's original repository. This can help improve support for other chips.
