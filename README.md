## What version of Zig to use

0.11.0

## Contributing

Please see the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/ZigEmbeddedGroup/projects/1/views/1), itâ€™s used as a place to brainstorm and organize work in ZEG. There will be issues marked as good first issue or drafts for larger ideas that need scoping/breaking ground on.

## Introduction

This repo contains the infrastructure for getting started in an embedded Zig project; it "gets you to main()". Specifically, it offers:

* a single easy-to-use builder function that:
  * generates your linker script
  * sets up packages and startup code
* generalized interfaces for common devices, such as UART.
* device drivers for interacting with external hardware
* an uncomplicated method to define xref:interrupts[interrupts]

## Getting Started

Search for your chip family in [the examples](https://downloads.microzig.tech/examples/) and get the archive.

You can easily get started based on that.

## Design

For MicroZig internals please see the [Design Document](docs/design.adoc).

## Developing

Right now, the developer experience is not optimal due to 0.11 not really supporting what we're doing at all.

If you want to test your changes, you gotta to the following:

**Step 1:** Create a deployment for local usage:

```sh-session
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/bundle.py --debug
preparing environment...
validating packages...
loaded packages:
  * microzig-build
  * examples:microchip/avr
  * examples:...
  * microzig-core
  * microchip/avr
  * ...
resolving inner dependencies...
creating packages...
bundling microzig-build...
bundling microzig-core...
bundling microchip/avr...
...
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ 
```

This command yields output in `./microzig-deploy` that is meant to be fetched via `http://localhost:8080/`.

**Step 2:** To serve the files on this port, you can start a pre-bundled web server:

```sh-session
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/demo-server.py
...
```

This way, you spawn a local HTTP server that will serve `./microzig-deploy` on port 8080 on your machine, and you can then
start fetching packages from this.

Now you can use curl to fetch the packages, or you can just create a local development project.

**Step 3:** You can use the tool `tools/patch-build-zon.py` to patch/upgrade your development project inplace:

```sh-session
[user@host] microzig-monorepo/ $ python3 ./tools/patch-build-zon.py /tmp/dev-project/build.zig.zon

```

## Repository structure

* `build/` contains the build components of MicroZig.
* `core/` contains the shared components of MicroZig.
* `board-support/` contains all official board support package.
* `examples/` contains examples that can be used with the board support packages.
* `tools/` contains tooling to work *on* MicroZig itself, so deployment, testing, ...
* `design/` contains images and logos

## Versioning Scheme

MicroZig versions are tightly locked with Zig versions.

The general scheme is `${zig_version}-${commit}-${count}`, so the MicroZig versions will look really similar to
Zigs versions, but with our own commit abbreviations and counters.

As MicroZig sticks to tagged Zig releases, `${zig_version}` will show to which Zig version the MicroZig build is compatible.

Consider the version `0.11.0-abcdef-123` means that this MicroZig version has a commit starting with `abcdef`, which was the 123rd commit of the version that is compatible with Zig 0.11.0.
