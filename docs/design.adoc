== Dependency Tree

The build portion of MicroZig sets up a dependency graph like the following.

image::deps.svg[]

Your application lives in `app`, that's where `main()` resides. `root` contains the entry point, and will set up [zero-initialized data] and [uninitialized data]. This is all encapsulated in an `EmbeddedExecutable` object. It has methods to add dependencies acquired from the package manager.

The `microzig` module has different namespaces, some are static, but the nodes you see in the diagram above are switched out according to your configured hardware.

== Configurable Modules under `microzig`

=== `cpu`

=== `chip`

=== `hal`

=== `board`

=== `config`
