== Dependency Tree

The build portion of MicroZig sets up a dependency graph like the following.

image::deps.svg[]

Your application lives in `app`, that's where `main()` resides. `root` contains the entry point, and will set up [zero-initialized data] and [uninitialized data]. You will be able to use the official package manager to add application-level dependencies.

Then there's `microzig`. Typically we'll try to import as `micro` as follows:

[source,zig]
----
const micro = @import("microzig");
----

The `microzig` package has different namespaces, some are static, but the nodes you see in the diagram above are switched out according to your configured hardware.

== `cpu`

== `chip`

== `hal`

== `board`
