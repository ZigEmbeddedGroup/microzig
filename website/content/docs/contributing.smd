# Contributing Guide

## Coding Style

In MicroZig we break from the suggested coding style by the ZSF:

- Use `snake_case` for functions and methods.
- When there is an acronym in a type name, we keep the acronym uppercase, and
  separate it from other components in the name with underscores. Some examples:
  - `GpioMask -> GPIO_Mask`
  - `DigitalIo -> Digital_IO`
  - `HttpsOverCan -> HTTPS_Over_CAN`

Like any naming convention, it is broken when appropriate. In the future we
will have linters suggest naming changes when you make a PR, but they will
never be mandatory.

## Monorepo

MicroZig is developed as a monorepo. In the past we had it split into a number
of small repos, but we found it difficult to maintain all those separate
components. The monorepo has shown a significant improvement in development
velocity and confidence in changes.

### Legend

Here is an overview of the top level directories of the monorepo:

- `build-internals`: Contents of the MicroZig build system.
- `core`: The framework for building the MicroZig import structure. MCU
  architecture specific code (ARM, AVR, RISCV, etc.).
- `design`: Visual assets used by MicroZig.
- `drivers`: MCU agnostic drivers for external devices.
- `examples`: Embedded application examples, these mirror the port directory
  structure. We intentionally keep examples outside port packages, both to
  simplify contents, and to demonstrate usage of the build system. This would
  not be as obvious if we kept examples in their port packages.
- `modules`: Packages that are useful for embedded applications, but are not
  dependent on MicroZig.
- `port`: MCU family specific code, HALs.
- `sim`: Software simulators for different MCU architectures.
- `tools`: Support software tools for generating register schemas, utilities
  for flashing MCUs.
- `website`: This website, which is built using [zine](https://zine-ssg.io).

### Packaging

MicroZig does not force users to download the entire codebase if they use a
released version. This is done through a small project called
[boxzer](https://github.com/mattnite/boxzer), which creates a separate tarball
for each package in MicroZig. With the use of lazy dependencies in the Zig
build system, a user will download the `esp` package for their hardware, but
nothing related to `stm32`. This will enable us to support a lot of hardware
without MicroZig users needing to download gigabytes everytime they run their
CI.

## Naming Sub-packages

We try to keep package names identical to their path in the project, with
underscores replacing path separators. Package names in Zig are limted to 32
bytes, so the earlier components are often shortened. We also try to keep `mz`
the first component in the name to denote the package as being part of
MicroZig. For example the `examples/stmicro/stm32` package has the name
`mz_ex_stmicro_stm32` as we've hit the name length limit

If a package is under `modules`, then the package has a single name for itself,
such as `foundationlibc`.

## Versioning and Release Process

MicroZig follows semantic versioning, and while all packages have their own
version, they are released as a single group.

- **Major**: Micro MicroZig will have a 0 for the major version until Zig reaches 1.0.
- **Minor**: We always depend on a stable release of Zig, and the minor version of
  MicroZig will always match the minor version of the compiler we depend on.
  Patch versions of the compiler are not reflected in this scheme.
- **Patch**: The patch number is incremented once every time we release, note that
  since MicroZig is 0.x, semantic versioning allows for breaks even between
  patch versions.
