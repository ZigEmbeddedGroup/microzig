_MicroZig is a toolbox for building embedded applications in Zig._


[Get Started](/docs/getting-started)

## Why Zig?

Zig is an excellent programming language for embedded systems.

- **Explicit allocators**: Zig's convention of passing an allocator interface to
  functions that may allocate results in a single standard library that is
  seamlessly used on freestanding targets.
- **Cross-compilation**: Zig's powerful build system targets many embedded
  architectures, MicroZig builds on top of this system to target specific
  microcontrollers.
- **C interop**: Directly include and link to C code with no FFI overhead.
- **Strategic friction**: aspects of programming that are tricky need to be
  explicit and even verbose at times. Nullable pointers, pointer casting,
  integer conversions, etc.

## Why MicroZig?

- **Tooling**: MicroZig extends the Zig build system for Microcontrollers. This
  includes:
  - Generating memory-mapped IO bindings from register descriptions
  - Generating a default linker script for your microcontroller (which you can
    override).
  - Giving you access to modules that provide high-level APIs for interacting
    with your CPU.
- **Low-cost Abstractions**: No abstraction is zero cost, but we've found the
  right fit at different layers. For example, our MMIO interface feels
  high-level, but every call results in a single read-modify-write to a
  register.
- **Bring your own hardware**: MicroZig is developed as a monorepo, but you can
  switch out any layer and use the overall framework. Provide your own register
  definitions for an uncontributed microcontroller, or build a custom PCB, yet
  still use the MicroZig build system and extra components such as our generic
  driver library.
